#tried sklearn libarary, used GaussianNB function, not working because it's for bayes classificaton.
#The output is always the same with the last price value.

#tried pymc for bayes curve fitting, failed.


functions:

#getfy(x):					generate Ï•(x)
#getInverseS():				get inverse of S
#getInverseS2(x):			get S^2
#getm(x):					get m(x), which is to be the predicted value

Have implemented the algorithm, but the output is extremely large. Which should be wrong.
